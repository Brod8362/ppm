PPM - Yet Another Game Boy Tile & Map Editor for GTK
====================================================

This was originally written by Ville Helin in 2000-2003. Please view it at his website [here.](https://www.villehelin.com/ppm.html)

I have simply fixed it so it compiles and runs with modern versions of GCC. Please view the original creator's website
I don't have intentions on doing much to this, but who knows.
